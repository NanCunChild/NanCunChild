- 👋 Hi, I’m @NanCunChild, a XDU student majoring Microelectronics Science and Engineering.
- 👀 But, I’m interested in Unity, C, C#, React, HTML, Python, Java and so on. Being derelect in duty...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MatLab, and I prefer studing in practice.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Echoer Project, Argus Project, WorkOutHelper Project...
- 📫 You can twitter me, @NanCunChild is me. Or Telegram, the same nickname.
- If you are Chinese, QICQ:1729138395 is an altnetive idea.
- And, One More Thing. I am just a hungry and tired collage student, not a full-time programmer. If you like my projects and not as hungry as I am, you can be one of my sponser.
